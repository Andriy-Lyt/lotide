# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @username/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@andy_web/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:
* `eqArrays(...)`: returns true if arrays are equal, false if not;
* `eqObjects(...)`: returns true if objects are equal, false if not;
* `findKey(...)`: returns key name that contains the value that matches criteria provided by callback function.

Description of the rest of functions is in the working progress...
